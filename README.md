### Install Vagrant
1. Go to vagrant website and download a osx64bits version
2. Let's start by changing the directory where vagrant install the vm
3. [change directory](http://www.thisprogrammingthing.com/2013/changing-the-directory-vagrant-stores-the-vms-in/)
4. Then we can run thoses commands
5. mkdir /Volumes/Storage/goinfre/INSERT_LOGIN/vagrant
6. echo 'export VAGRANT_HOME=/Volumes/Storage/goinfre/INSERT_LOGIN/vagrant' >> ~/.zshrc
7. vagrant init debian/stretch64 (to generate the file automatically, synced line will be missing)
8. we need to put theses 4 lines if they are not in the Vagrantfile
```sh
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
config.vm.box = "debian/stretch64"
config.vm.synced_folder ".", "/git"
end
```
9. vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest
10. vagrant up
11. vagrant vbguest
12. then we can 1- lanch the vm, 2- install virtualbox guest addition to have a directory monted and sync with local system and 3- start it
